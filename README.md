	1-800-IMBORED is a lot easier to remember than 1-800-462-6733.
For that reason, most numbers on phone keypads are associated
with a certain set of letters. The associations are standardized
as follows:\
\
`0- no letters\
1- no letters\
2- abc\
3- def\
4- ghi\
5- jkl\
6- mno\
7- pqrs\
8- tuv\
9- wxyz\`
\
For many people's phone passwords, they often choose to spell out
a word. It can be meaningful or completely random and it happens often.
For example, my mother's phone password used to be 3825 and her computer
password was a combination of mine nd my sister's name for a number of years.\

This code, given a specific wordlist, maps every word to a combination of
numbers and visualizes the frequency of each combination. Have a 6-letter
password you want to try to crack? Feed a wordlist of 6-letter words through
this program. The quality of the guesses depends entirely on the quality of
the wordlist. This tool is just to help you look at your odds.\
