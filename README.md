	1-800-IMBORED is a lot easier to remember than 1-800-462-6733.
For that reason (complete speculation), most numbers on phone keypads
are associated with a certain set of letters. The associations are
standardized as follows:\
\
0- no letters\
1- no letters\
2- abc\
3- def\
4- ghi\
5- jkl\
6- mno\
7- pqrs\
8- tuv\
9- wxyz\
\
For many people's phone and device passwords, they often choose to spell out
a word. It can be meaningful or completely random and it happens often.
For example, my mother's phone password used to be 3825 (see if you can figure that
one out) and her computer password was a combination of mine and my sister's name
for a number of years.\

This code, given a wordlist, maps words to their number equivalent and
graphs the frequency of each combination. Have a 6-letter password you
want to try to crack? Feed a wordlist of 6-letter words through
this program. The quality of the combinations depends entirely on the quality of
the wordlist. This tool is just to help you look at your odds.
